* Goal
  The goal of this project is to duplicate and extend the NeXT application
  'open' in Haskell. Open is a command line utility that opens a file using the
  correct application, where the built-in 'launch services' feature of OS X
  determines the correct application.

** Extensions
   So far I added the ability to open an arbitrary number of programs
   simultaneously.

* License
  GPL. I really like freedom and I want to cut and paste that in here later.
